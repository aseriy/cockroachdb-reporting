# cockroachdb-reporting
Reference implementation for Part 2 of “Rethinking the Reporting Platform.” Demonstrates a multi-region CockroachDB setup for unified transactional and reporting workloads, with example schema, queries, and supporting code.



Regions

```sql
-- South Carolina (us-east1) -- PRIMARY
ALTER DATABASE nextgenreporting ADD REGION "gcp-us-east1";
-- Iowa (us-central1)
ALTER DATABASE nextgenreporting ADD REGION "gcp-us-central1";
-- California (us-west2)
ALTER DATABASE nextgenreporting ADD REGION "gcp-us-west2";
-- London (europe-west2)
ALTER DATABASE nextgenreporting ADD REGION "gcp-europe-west2";
-- Frankfurt (europe-west3)
ALTER DATABASE nextgenreporting ADD REGION "gcp-europe-west3";
-- São Paulo (southamerica-east1)
ALTER DATABASE nextgenreporting ADD REGION "gcp-southamerica-east1";
```


```sql
SHOW REGIONS FROM DATABASE nextgenreporting;             
```

```bash
      database     | region | primary | secondary | zones
-------------------+--------+---------+-----------+--------
  nextgenreporting | tx1    |    t    |     f     | {}
  nextgenreporting | ar1    |    f    |     f     | {}
  nextgenreporting | ar2    |    f    |     f     | {}
  nextgenreporting | ar3    |    f    |     f     | {}
  nextgenreporting | report |    f    |     f     | {}
  nextgenreporting | tx2    |    f    |     f     | {}
  nextgenreporting | tx3    |    f    |     f     | {}
(7 rows)
```



Add regions to the database:

```sql
ALTER DATABASE nextgenreporting SURVIVE REGION FAILURE;
```

```sql
ALTER DATABASE nextgenreporting SET PRIMARY REGION "tx1";
ALTER DATABASE nextgenreporting SET SECONDARY REGION 'tx2';
ALTER DATABASE nextgenreporting ADD region 'tx3';
ALTER DATABASE nextgenreporting ADD SUPER REGION "transact" VALUES  "tx1","tx2","tx3"
ALTER DATABASE nextgenreporting ADD region 'report';
ALTER DATABASE nextgenreporting ADD region 'ar1';
ALTER DATABASE nextgenreporting ADD region 'ar2';
ALTER DATABASE nextgenreporting ADD region 'ar3';
ALTER DATABASE nextgenreporting ADD SUPER REGION "archive" VALUES  "ar1","ar2","ar3"
```

```sql
ALTER DATABASE nextgenreporting ADD SUPER REGION "transact" VALUES "tx1", "tx2", "tx3";
ALTER TABLE datapoints SET LOCALITY REGIONAL BY ROW;
```

List ranges associated with a table:

```sql
SELECT range_id, range_size, lease_holder, replicas, replica_localities FROM                
crdb_internal.ranges WHERE range_id IN (SELECT range_id FROM

```sql

  SELECT crdb_region, crdb_internal_at_station_shard_16,
  station, at
  FROM datapoints LIMIT 1000 OFFSET 0

Disk space per node:

```sql
SELECT
  s.node_id,
  n.locality,
  sum(s.used) AS used_bytes

Reporting queries:

```sql
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS ON datapoints (at);
```



Materialized View (Reporting Region)

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW datapoints_mv AS
SELECT  d.at, d.station, g.name,
        d.param0, d.param1, d.param2,
        d.param3, d.param4,
        d.param5,d.param6
FROM stations as s
JOIN datapoints as d ON s.id = d.station
JOIN geos AS g ON s.geo = g.id;
```

```sql
ALTER TABLE datapoints_mv CONFIGURE ZONE USING
    range_min_bytes = 134217728,
    range_max_bytes = 536870912,
    gc.ttlseconds = 600,
    global_reads = true,
    num_replicas = 3,
    num_voters = 3,
    constraints = '{+region=report: 3}',
    voter_constraints = '{+region=report}',
    lease_preferences = '[[+region=report]]';
```



Vector Search

Create vector index in transact / archive regions:

```sql
CREATE VECTOR INDEX ON datapoints (param6);
```


Create vector index on the materialized view:

```sql
CREATE VECTOR INDEX ON datapoints_mv (param6);
```

JSONB

```sql
SELECT jsonb_pretty(param5) AS param5 FROM datapoints_mv LIMIT 5;
```

```sql
SELECT rowid, param5 FROM datapoints_mv
CROSS JOIN LATERAL jsonb_object_keys(param5) AS key
GROUP BY rowid, param5
HAVING count(*) BETWEEN 3 AND 10
LIMIT 10;
```

```sql
CREATE INVERTED INDEX param5_keys_idx ON datapoints_mv (param5);
```

```sql
SELECT rowid
FROM datapoints_mv
WHERE param5 ? 'ekzny';
```

or nested

```sql
SELECT rowid
FROM datapoints_mv
WHERE param5 @> '{"ekzny": {}}';
```

“Even with totally unstructured JSON, CockroachDB can index and answer shape questions efficiently.”

deep nesting

```sql
SELECT rowid
FROM datapoints_mv
WHERE param5 @> '{"ekzny":{"pawkfrrle":{}}}';
```





CDC

```sql
SET CLUSTER SETTING kv.rangefeed.enabled = true;
